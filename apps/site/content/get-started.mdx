# Get Started with Nectar

Install and initialize Nectar in your Next.js repo.

```bash
pnpm nectar init --write
```

Analyze with a build manifest and sizes file:

```bash
pnpm nectar analyze --fixture ... --sizes ...
```

See suggested transforms, without applying:

```bash
pnpm nectar codemod --json
```

Apply the plan transactionally (with type-safe rollback):

```bash
pnpm nectar codemod --apply --plan .nectar/plan.json
```

That's it! Read more in the rest of the docs.
